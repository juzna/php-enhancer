# PhpEnhancer examples

Each example is in one directory. It contains:
- **custom enhancer** (`FooEnhancer.php`) which alters PHP code somehow
- **demo classes** (`classes`) with experimental syntax, which will be converted by *enhancer*
- **runner** (`test.php`) which set-ups the enhancer and runs some tests
