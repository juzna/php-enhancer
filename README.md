# FWrapper for PHP

Execute a callback when *include*-ing or *require*-ing a file in PHP and possibly replace the file being included. Or, even better, *enhance* it!



## Instalation

As any other php extension:
```
	cd ext/fwrapper
	phpize
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
```

or you can compile it directly to our PHP when you're compiling it by `--enable-fwrapper`.



## Usage
See examples.
